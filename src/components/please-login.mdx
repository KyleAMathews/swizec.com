<Video id="L8Sx28i2NZw" />

ServerlessReact.Dev is a video course that shows you how to build a modern webapp from scratch to launch using the hyper productive modern web stack.

You'll learn everything you need to **become a fullstack frontend engineer.**

ServerlessReact.Dev is focused on practical examples and showing you the whole process. Warts and all.

When you follow a polished tutorial, you learn how to build _that_ thing. But your skills don't transfer. And when something goes wrong, you're stuck.

With ServerlessReact.Dev you get a behind-the-scenes look. I'll show you how to debug problems, how to design a solution, where to start, and when to say good enough.

Learn **the pragmatic way to build modern apps**.

We start with some theory, learn the stack, do some practical exercises to get a feel for technologies, _then build a whole app_. From a list of features to accepting payments.
