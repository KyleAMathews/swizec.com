# Module 3: Building your app

<Vimeo id="392226129" />

In [Module 3](/module-3) you start creating an app based on the framework you set up in [Module 2](/module-2). Much of the focus goes towards CRUD - create, read, update, delete - operations based on GraphQL and DynamoDB working together.

You can find code for this module [on GitHub](https://github.com/Swizec/markdownlandingpage.com). Commits follow the flow of these videos.
