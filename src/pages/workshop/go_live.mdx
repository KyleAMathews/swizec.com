# Going live

There's a few approaches you can use to make the project live. I recommend Netlify or Zeit.

You'll need the following:

- add your project to github
- use a netlify or zeit github integration
- use their webhook to redeploy your project when a new page is created

That last part gives you the benefits of static pages. Otherwise you're always re-fetching fresh data :)
