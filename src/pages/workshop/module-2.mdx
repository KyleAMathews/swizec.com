# Part 2: Setting up the basics

We're going to build a markdown landing page generator. You can think of it as a simple blog as well. Maybe a little silly, but it's just complex enough to exercise the stack, learn some skills, and is in fact a product I wanted to build and use.

To save time, we'll skip most of the setup and use a starter repo instead.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Swizec/serverless-react-workshop-starter.git
cd serverless-react-workshop-starter
```

You get a repository with two directories:

- `webapp` for your webapp code
- `server` for your serverless server code

We use separate `package.json` files for the webapp and server. Install both.

```shell
cd webapp
yarn
```

```shell
cd server
yarn
```

Alternatively run `npm install` in each directory. I'll be using `yarn`, but everything should work just as well with npm.

When you start the webapp with `yarn start` or `npm start`, you'll see a blank page.

Swizec explains what's been configured for you.
