# Part 3: Play around with GraphQL

We're going to use a lot of GraphQL in our app. This is your chance to play around with GraphQL using a schema just like we're going to build in our app.

## The basics

GraphQL works by defining the shape of what you're looking for.

```graphql
query {
    what_you_want {
        its_property
    }
}
```

You use mutations to save data.

```graphql
mutation {
    yourMutation(prop1: "value", prop2: "value") {
        return_value
    }
}
```

Try using the autocomplete feature and the schema definition in the playground above to complete these 4 exercises.
