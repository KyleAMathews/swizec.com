## Find your idea

You know how to build whatever your heart desires.

But how do you come up with a good idea? How do you choose which product is worth building? How do you find and validate a market? Ultimately, how do you make sure you're not wasting your time?

Join this mini course and learn the process I use to create and validate ideas, discover customer pains, and learn what's worth building.

## Turn your idea into a business

You know what to build and you know how to build it. That means you're way ahead of most people. Congratz!

But how do you turn a launched product into a business you can rely on? How do you build a marketing engine that turns visitors into customers?

Join this course and learn everything I've learned making my first **$100,000 in product sales**. And how I turned that success into a predictable monthly income I can rely on.

Learn how to think about marketing like an engineer, build a funnel, and create a stable marketing engine that runs itself.
