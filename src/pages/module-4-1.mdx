# Listing user pages on the dashboard

In this section we list user pages on the dashboard. Login, see the pages you own, edit anything, create new ones.

Very friendly :)

## Use static query to load page list

<Vimeo id="396353247" />

## Render page list

<Vimeo id="396353389" />

## Static-to-dynamic page list

<Vimeo id="396963395" />

## Refactor to a custom hook

<Vimeo id="396962723" />

## An idea you can try

Right now you have to reload the dashboard to see new pages on the list after creating. Would be cool, if that happened dynamically.

Try to update the pageList as soon as the user clicks `Create`
