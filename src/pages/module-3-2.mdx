# Create user landing pages

This is the meat of our app. Users creating their beautiful landing pages using nothing but markdown.

We create a simple editor and leverage Gatsby's markdown rendering machinery to create static pages from our DynamoDB database using GraphQL at build time. When the page renders, we refresh its state live from the server just in case.

## A simple dashboard component

## A create page form

<Vimeo id="392506657" />

## createPage mutation on button click

For better accessibility you should wrap the form in a `<form>` tag and use the `onSubmit` event to run your mutation. But we're hacking a basic MVP so using clicks is fine :)
