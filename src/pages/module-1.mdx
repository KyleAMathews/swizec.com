# Module 1: The modern stack and mental models

In [Module 1](/module-1) you will learn about the modern stack and some mental models about how it works. We discuss how to think about building a modern app, what to consider when deploying your infrastructure, and what each piece of the puzzle is doing for us.

There are some light exercises for you to practice GraphQL.
